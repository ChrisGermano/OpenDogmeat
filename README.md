## Reddit performance analysis for independent developers and small studios

OpenDogmeat is an open-source performance analysis toolkit for game developers utilizing Reddit for social marketing, development blogging, and content distribution. Project Dogmeat originated as a B2B audience analysis tool in late 2016, with the ultimate goal being a predictive performance service.

### OpenDogmeat is under ACTIVE development

That being said, the name is a placeholder, the code is regularly being updated, and very little is being commented for public consumption. Feel free to offer advice and suggestions, though!
